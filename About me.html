    <h2>Glips into me.</h2>
    <p> I'm an adventures driven young man who has has the habit for intesity over consistancy. I grew up all over south africa going to 7 primary schools and moving around bi yearly.
        which I happily attribute my adaptibily and problem solving skills to. When we finally settled down in Cape Town I went to fairmont where I made friends and generally enjoyed my time.
        I love learning new and interesting skills not so much studying but I do enjoy reading. I don't know everything but I believe I am more than capable of find any answer and I have 
        the determination to keep going untill I have the answer.

    <h3>Cape To Cairo Cycle</h3>
    <p>After high school I and two other individuals cycled accross the continent from Cape Town to Cairo. While on this incredible journey I experience the different people and their incredible cultures
        from a point of view few people do. This experience matured me and gave me a unique perspective on our beautiful continent.
