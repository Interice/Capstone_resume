    <h2>Glimps into me.</h2>
    <p> I'm an adventure driven young man who has the habit for intensity over consistency. I grew up all over South Africa going to seven primary schools and moving around bi yearly. which I happily attribute my adaptability and problem-solving skills to. When we finally settled down in Cape Town, I went to Fairmont High School where I made friends and generally enjoyed my time. I love learning new and interesting skills although studying isn’t my passion, but I do enjoy reading. I don't know everything, but I believe I am more than capable of find any answer and I have the determination to keep going until I have the answer

    <h3>Cape To Cairo Cycle</h3>
    <p>After high school I and two other individuals cycled across the continent from Cape Town to Cairo. While on this incredible journey I experience the different people and their incredible cultures from a point of view few people do. This experience matured me and gave me a unique perspective on our beautiful continent.
